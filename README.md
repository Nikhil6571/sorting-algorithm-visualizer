# 🔢 Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive web-based application that visually demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work step by step.  
This project helps in understanding algorithm behavior, time complexity, and performance differences using animations.

## 📌 Features

- 🎲 Generate **Random**, **Best Case**, and **Worst Case** arrays
- 📊 Visualizes sorting using animated bars
- ⏱️ Real-time **Execution Time** calculation
- 🔢 Live **Comparison Counter**
- 📈 Displays **Time Complexity** of each algorithm
- 🎚️ Adjustable **Speed Control**
- 📏 Adjustable **Array Size**
- 🌙 Modern **Dark UI**
- 🔒 Buttons disabled during sorting to prevent conflicts

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

### 1️⃣ Bubble Sort
- Best Case: `O(n)`
- Average Case: `O(n²)`
- Worst Case: `O(n²)`
- Stable and in-place
- Simple but inefficient for large data

### 2️⃣ Merge Sort
- Best / Average / Worst Case: `O(n log n)`
- Uses divide and conquer
- Requires extra memory
- Stable and consistent performance

### 3️⃣ Quick Sort
- Best / Average Case: `O(n log n)`
- Worst Case: `O(n²)`
- In-place and very fast in practice
- Performance depends on pivot selection

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure of the application
- **CSS3** – Styling and dark-themed UI
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Sorting logic, animations, and DOM manipulation
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control
- **GitHub Pages** – Deployment

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Array values are generated and represented as vertical bars.
2. Each sorting algorithm compares and swaps elements step by step.
3. Animations are controlled using `async/await` and delays.
4. Comparisons and execution time are updated in real time.
5. Best and worst case buttons help analyze algorithm efficiency.

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Add more algorithms (Insertion, Selection, Heap Sort)
- Mobile responsiveness
- Comparison chart inside UI
- Sound effects toggle
- Step-by-step pause mode
